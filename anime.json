            "description": "Pesawat yang jatuh di Kampar, Riau, adalah jet tempur Hawk 200. Pesawat ini didesain untuk melakukan penyerangan ke darat.Berapa harga pesawat jet tempur buatan British Aerospace (BAE), Inggris tersebut? Mengutip situs Aircraft Compare, harga satu unit Hawk 200 mencapai US$ 29 juta atau sekitar Rp 412,4 miliar (Kurs: Rp 14.420). Dengan begitu, spesifikasinya pun tak main-main. Pesawat ini bermesin Turbo Fan 871 Adour twin-spool. Mesin turbofan rendah ini merupakan produk dari Rolls-Royce. Pesawat ini mampu melesat 1,2 kali kecepatan suara, atau setara dengan 1.470 km/jam dengan membawa berbagai persenjataan. Berdasarkan catatan pemberitaan detikcom pada 2012, jet tempur yang didesain khusus untuk melaksanakan misi 'air to ground attack' atau penyerangan ke darat ini memang dikenal lincah dan mudah dikendalikan. Sejumlah senjata tempur bisa dipasang di badan pesawat ini. Dari rudal udara ke darat AGM-65 Maverick, rudal anti-kapal Sea Eagle, torpedo, serta berbagai macam bom. Radar canggih berjenis APG-66 yang biasa digunakan di pesawat F-16 juga sudah terpasang di Hawk 200. Dilansir dari Skybrary, ukuran Hawk 200 punya panjang 11,23 meter dan tingginya 4,13 meter. Rentang sayapnya 9,39 meter. Karena ukuran pesawat kecil, kemampuan jelajahnya pun juga terbatas. Namun kelemahan itu bisa disiasati dengan dukungan pesawat tanker KC-130B. Pesawat ini mampu melakukan pengisian bahan bakar saat di udara. Pesawat ini sendiri ditempatkan di sejumlah kawasan Indonesia yaitu di Pontianak dan Pekanbaru. Pesawat ini juga memiliki fasilitas kursi lontar. Seperti diketahui, pesawat Tempur milik TNI AU jenis Hawk 200 jatuh di Kampar, Riau. Pesawat tersebut sedang latihan. "Itu pesawat dari Lanud Pekanbaru, latihan biasa, normal," kata Kepala Dinas Penerangan (Kadispen) TNI AU Marsma Fajar Adriyanto saat dimintai konfirmasi detikcom, Senin (15/6/2020).",

What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.",
